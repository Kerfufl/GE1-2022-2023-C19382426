# Games Engines 1 Assignment 2022-2023 - The Six Million Dollar Man's Lava Lamp

Your task is to create a hologram of an appliance or artwork from a futuristic home of the future as imagined from 1970's sci-fi. Some examples:

- The six million dollar mans lava lamp
- A self playing guitar or piano
- A volcano
- A fire place with futuristic effects
- A harry potter style book or picture that comes to life
- An alien in a jar
- AN R2D2 type robot
- An abstract audio responsive artwork
- An octopus in a tank
- A futuristic machine with lots of lights and moving parts
 
Here are some retro vintage sci-fi references you can Google 

Some ideas:

- This thing for holding the Medusan Ambassador:

Please include a detailed readme.md in your git repo. Here is [a template](assignmentreadme.md). In order to help me grade the assignments include in your readme:

- A detailed description of what your assignment does and how it works
- Which parts of the assignment you developed yourself vs parts that come from the examples we made on the course or that come from tutorials
- What you are most proud of about the assignment 
- Instructions for building and running (if necessary)
- Include an embedded youtube video of the assignment in the readme.md and also submit the Youtube video link in the submission form. If you are on Windows 10 you can press Windows Key, Alt and R to take a video. [This is how you can capture videos if you are on a Mac](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/20/how-to-record-the-screen-on-my-mac.html). Also you can use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
- Make your video from a BUILD not the Unity Editor
This is an example of how you can embed a youtube video in a markdown file:

```

For example, this URL: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii049d7UFrg

Becomes:

```

# Due dates:
- Week 5 - Proposal & git repo
- Week 11 - Final submission & in-class demos

 You should use good OO practices aligned with the GameObject/MonoBehavior model that Unity uses. In other words, use inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces to implement game components.

 # Rubric
 
 | Grade | Profile |
 |-------|---------|
 | First | You will have spent in excess of 20 hours on the assignment. There will be 80+ git check-ins. Your demo will look impressive and or beautiful and or very novel and cool. A cool looking and fun hologram that is a good example of the theme. Something you would be proud to show off to visitors to your home. A complex implementation. Your system will be exposed to Unity properly via game components, gizmos and editors. It will be of the quality of a â‚¬10 asset from the Unity Asset Store |
 | 2.1   | You will have spend 10-16 hours on the assignment with around 30-70 check-ins. For example, long methods here and there without enough granularity. You might not have exposed all the editors and gizmos that your system might benefit from and your system might be not so customisable| 
 | 2.2   | You will spend around a day on the assignment and will have implemented a simple system based on sine waves or similar. You might have around 30 check-ins or less. Your solutions is one or two game components in complexity. There might be random colours no audio or inappropriate audio. Your system might glitch a bit and would need a fair bit of future work to make it publishable or useful|
 | Pass  | You will spend less than a day on the assignment and get something very basic implemented like a spiral or a simple voxel world. No git use or evidence of many check-ins|
 | Fail  | Nothing works, and no git. Looks like it took a few hours to make |
